## I am learning programming because...

For some years before i thought about learning programming so I started with Java. I'm self-learner and when I started then, I couldn't combine learning programming with my studies so i had to quit.

After studies i started to work and then I realized it's not really what I like to do, i realized that i need an environment where I can really develop myself and it's up to me what I can do about that. Including teamwork and great society, sharing knowledge, i've found programming a place where i'm feeling good.

I'm looking forward to learn more and more about software development, architecture, patterns and stuff around.
       
## Additional activities
    
- I participate in CodersCamp where i'm learning programming and we are doing team projects under the supervision of mentors.
